# Fairy of Grass :fairy:
:octocat: Auto generating Github contributions using Github Actions.

# How to use
1. :arrow_down: Create a repository from this template. ([Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template))
2. :lock: Add your Github email address in Github Secrets as USER_EMAIL. ([Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository))
3. :smile: Done!

# How it works
It runs around 16:30(GMT) on saturdays & sundays except in the month of Jan & Dec And it makes an empty commit to add contribution to your Github profile.<br>
